## Summary

Briefed to create an app to solve a specific user problem, I developed a productivity app that would help my user overcome distractions with gentle ‘nudges’ reminding them to get back to work.

The resulting app, Nudge, allowed the user to set specific work blocks and designate how quickly to be reminded if they became distracted by their phone or moved away from their work desk.

If you can’t be bothered to read / hate reading / can’t read, you can just check out the prototype [here](https://invis.io/3GD9R47Y4#/251066851_Home).

## The Brief

For this individual project at General Assembly, we interviewed a specific user in order to find problems that could be solved using a simple mobile application. The final deliverable: a high-fidelity prototype of the new application.

**Sprint length:** 2 weeks.

**Skills required:** User interviews, Participatory Design, Sketching, Rapid Prototyping, Product/Visual Design.

## Background

My core user was Idil, a young married Londoner working as a graphic designer at a creative agency in the city. She expressed a strong desire for continual self-improvement and lifelong learning, through reading articles online, taking courses and extra-curricular design challenges.

## Challenge

I conducted an extensive user interview to discover key aspects of Idil’s life in an attempt to identify problems that could be solved using a mobile application. It was obvious that Idil was a very motivated self-starter and so I dug down into her habits in regards to learning, and discovered:

- Idil struggles to find articles relevant to her interests, and has been trying Flipboard recently without much joy

- To support her learning, she tries to get about an hour’s extra study done each night, but often gets distracted and never comes back to the work

I explored each problem with her before deciding to try to address the latter, and formulated a **problem statement**:

> Idil wants to get work done at home but often gets distracted for when she sits down to do it.

It was clear that if an app could simply and effectively reduce distraction for Idil, she would happily use it to improve her learning process.

Now a problem had been found, it was time to explore all the potential solutions for it.

## Process

### User Research & Concept Map

I sat down with Idil again to better understand her problem, and the factors that affected her study habits. I quickly realised during the second interview that distraction would be an extremely difficult problem to solve, in that a lot of its causes are psychological, rather than logistical, and unfortunately I’m not a behavioural psychologist! The rule of ‘Five Why’s’ didn’t seem to work in this context:

Why do you get distracted?

> Because I go to make a cup of tea and I then decide to clean the kitchen for an hour.

Why do you clean the kitchen for an hour rather than go back to work?

> Because it seems easier than going back to work.

Why does it seem easier than going back to work?

> I don’t know, because I just procrastinate for no reason…

Why do you procrastinate for no reason?

> I really don’t know, because I’m a terrible person?

Why are you a terrible person?

> I DON’T KNOW!

Joking aside, I did find there were ways for me to address the problem. I constructed a detailed concept map that allowed me to visually understand the problem. Most importantly, I learnt a lot by digging down into the ‘indicators of success’ and ‘indicators of failure’: that is, what environmental factors were conducive to her having a successful study session, and what factors were present when she got distracted.

<light-box @src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2472/1*cX2rUX6xQ0S4uicOUV_FgQ.png">The final concept map, with indicators of success and failure in the bottom left corner.</light-box>

Idil said she was successful when she had a deadline, when she started work in the morning, when she was reminded to get back to work by her husband, and when she was able to get into a flow state. Her key indicators of failure included an abundance of time mentality, when she set her study goal too high for the day and it seemed insurmountable, and a number of apps that she had tried.

This lead me to my final key discovery that strongly influenced design decisions. Idil had tried and failed to use productivity apps, and had strong feelings about the way that they would ‘guide’ her through her study. She was very self-motivated, and felt that they ‘babied’ her through the process, without allowing her to do her work. She also resented apps that blocked her access to social media, and found them petty since she was a mature adult and wanted to, in her words, “_believe in herself_”, and in her own ability to restrict her usage of these sites.

> I don’t want to be disconnected, I just want to be regulated.

It was clear that she didn’t want to be restricted from being distracted, but rather be reminded at some point to go back to work, so she wouldn’t waste hours on these distractions.

### Storyboard

The user interview found two main types of distractions:

- **Digital**: Idil would often quickly check Facebook and end up reading a load of articles and never going back to work.

- **Physical**: Idil would head to the kitchen to make a snack and end up doing housework for an hour.

My app would need to solve both these problems — and with GPS technology and accelerometers, this would definitely be possible. I decided that my app would allow a user to set ‘work blocks’ of time in which they would be reminded each time they moved away from their desk or browsed on their phones. My next step was to storyboard the ideal user scenario for the app:

<light-box @src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5082/1*Q52X6kLbDu0mYOawjE8eXQ.jpeg">1: Situation - 2 & 3: Problem - 4: Solution - 5: Outcome</light-box>

## Solution

It was time to start building the app that would solve Idil’s problem, so I grabbed my favourite colour post-it note (orange, for those looking for Christmas present ideas) and got to it.

### User Flow

Building on all the information gathered from Idil as well as the storyboard, I constructed a user flow that accurately represented the screens required to set up a work block (called a ‘sprint’), the distraction notification settings, and then start the sprint. My user flow assumed that the user would be distracted once, to demonstrate the key functionality of the app. Whilst this wasn’t the ideal route, which would be not getting distracted at all (wouldn’t that be wonderful!) it did allow us to understand better how the app would work in a real-world scenario.

### Sketches, wireflows and paper prototypes

My next step was to start sketching up preliminary screens, and did some quick sketches to get user feedback on:

<light-box @src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5544/1*4MMsOIQad_tFFCJkhFqjAw.jpeg"></light-box>

My user Idil immediately gave me some valuable points: she found the ‘sprint set-up’ screen confusing and thought there were too many options on the ‘sprint’ screen. I realised that one of the biggest potential problems with the app would be learnability: it was important for a user to be able to pick it up and understand it immediately, but the concept itself was quite hard to communicate. I decided to strip back my app to an MVP bare essentials experience, removing quite a few features (motivational messages and notification blocker), and built a more simple wireflow:

<light-box @src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/5168/1*nnYZq6tscYSba8CFfOALJw.jpeg"></light-box>

The wireflow tested very well and I found that the step-by-step set-up screens had a dual role, both giving the user control over the settings but also orienting them about how the app worked.

At this time, I also decided upon a right-to-left swipe action to navigate from one screen to the next, as well as a button in the bottom right corner in case the user preferred to use this. This not only provided an easy navigation system, but gave the user a simple conceptual model about where they were situated in terms of the app at all times.

<light-box @src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*bYHUFBwTXoYUKqPhcbFKOA.jpeg"></light-box>

It was time to construct a paper prototype, and then open up testing to more users than simply my core user. The above image shows six of the eight final screens that made up the paper prototype, simplified to the most important elements in helping the user resolve their problem.

Most user tests received very strong positive user feedback, and also highlighted some areas that could be improved upon, which I then changed and re-tested with other users. Some of these changes included:

- Making the timer show at all times, rather than be hidden. I thought that perhaps the timer would distract a user, but this did not seem the case in testing.

- Removing the ‘screen takeover’ option, which was not deemed important enough for the MVP.

### Getting down and digital

I then took the prototype to low and mid fidelity, at each stage testing the prototype with users to improve upon the designs. Users were _still_ getting confused about how to set up the app on their first go, and I made many changes to resolve this:

- Switching around the order of some of the set-up options into a more logical order that made more sense to my users.

- Adding a summary of the options that they have selected on the final screen before commencing the sprint:

<light-box @src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2470/1*sOMu2RFtXPAB8sK8BMcxbA.png"></light-box>

Once all this testing was completed (phew!), I needed to make some design decisions before taking the prototype to high-fidelity. I wanted to create a feeling of ‘softness’ with the app, a feeling of bliss and simplicity that would create a space in which users could get work done. The mood board I created reflected these feelings:

<light-box @src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2456/1*yumO5fGvduVgAoAFL65mjg.png"></light-box>

A strong theme in the mood board was multicoloured gradients, and I decided to use these gradients not only as a aesthetic choice but across screens as a paradigm for the navigation of the app: that is, as the user swipes through screens during the set up and move towards their goal (the ‘Completed’ screen), the gradient turns from red to green.

<light-box @src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2422/1*r4Wi7i9kZqCPgWbY9ybq8Q.png"></light-box>

This tested extremely well with users and added a lot of personality to the app without overwhelming the interface.

### Interactive Prototype

The transition into Invision made a huge difference to the aforementioned navigation/conceptual mapping of the app, due to the ability to add left-to-right slide transitions to move from one page to the next.

The final clickable prototype can be viewed [here](https://invis.io/3GD9R47Y4#/251066851_Home).

## Results

The project was challenging and required a tonne of problem solving skills to get to a solution. The feedback from the users I tested was very positive and I had a lot of suggestions for more features, which I took as an indicator of interest! I really learnt a lot about having a user-centred focus and making sure that at every step you get feedback to make sure you continue in the right direction.

### Next Steps

There are a number of directions in which this app could be taken, and the features that could be added are really limitless — as highlighted earlier, this is a curse as much as it is a blessing. Some of the key features that I believe would help Idil further, based on the user interviews, are:

- Rewards: allowing a user to reward themselves for getting sprints done

- Motivational messages: allowing a user to write themselves messages that they would then be sent later to remind why they should get back to work

- Daily tracking of progress: logging user’s progress in a calendar to motivate them to get a sprint done every day.
