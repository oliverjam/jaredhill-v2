For an African bank with presence in 17 African countries, I helped build a greenfield corporate banking platform with the aim of eventually overhauling the process across all regions. We went from idea to a product in the hands of customers in 14 weeks, completely redesigning the way that the bank's clients applied for and received transaction products. I led a design team of four as we undertook user interviews on the ground in Uganda, workshopped and tested solutions, designed the responsive PWA and managed delivery with the development team. 

By creating a highly transparent, accessible process, the MVP was able to reduce lead times on applications from 2–3 days down to less than an hour. Thanks to extremely strong feedback from users, the product is now being iterated upon and rolled out in other markets. The project also won the Innovation in Digital Banking Award by The Banker.
