## Summary

CitizenM is a hotel chain that focuses on being innovative, youthful, and different. As part of a mock two-week design sprint on the UX Immersive course at General Assembly, I was tasked with creating a responsive, mobile-first website for CitizenM that would allow travellers to plan and book ‘local’ experiences.

Together with a team of two other UX designers, we carried out extensive research that found that _trust_ was an extremely important factor for the modern traveller when booking experiences. We designed Citizen App, which allows users to search, explore and book local experiences through actual local guides, moving the emphasis away from the experiences themselves and onto _those that know the most about them_. The app empowers any local with knowledge about their city to show tourists around, and in turn, gives tourists access to more authentic travel experiences.

If you’ve already heard enough of my yabbering, you can view the final clickable prototype [here](https://invis.io/2MDGTB1RN#/253175213_City_Picker).

## Background

CitizenM is a Netherlands-based hotel chain, with hotels in 5 locations throughout Europe, including in London, Amsterdam, and Paris.

They’re an innovative brand that look to offer ‘affordable luxury’ for a new breed of traveller, a traveller who ‘crosses oceans the way other people cross streets.’

### The Brief

Myself and two other UX designers were tasked with _building a responsive, mobile-first website_ that would allow recreational and business travellers to plan and book ‘local’ experiences, making it easier for them to get to know a place through the eyes of those that live locally.

**Sprint length:** 2 weeks

**Skills required:** User interviews, Affinity Mapping, Experience mapping, Competitor Analysis, Feature prioritisation, Screener surveys, Design studio, User flows, Wireframing, Rapid prototyping, User testing, Visual Design.

### My Role

Whilst each team member played a role in every step of the process, I was particularly involved in the competitive analysis, design strategy, and mid to high fidelity prototyping.

## Discovery

### Brand review & site visit

CitizenM is an extremely distinctive brand, and if we were to design an app that was a natural extension of the brand and suited to its current customers, then we would have to firstly get a 360 degree view of what they represented.

By visiting their Shoreditch hotel, interviewing employees, and doing a deep-dive into their website, a few things were clear:

- **CitizenM’s brand is their selling point:** The CitizenM brand is bold and quirky, colourful, and extremely strong across all touchpoints. They know what they represent and shout about it.

- **CitizenM is not for everyone:** Part of having a strong brand is not being afraid to alienate some customer segments. CitizenM is loved by those it appeals to, but its aesthetics and messaging is not for everyone.

- **CitizenM targets a very specific user:** CitizenM make it clear who their target customer is: the _‘new breed of traveller.’_ This seems independent of age and social group — customers in the hotel ranged from early 20s to early 50s and included business people and artsy types — and is more focussed on common interests, including travel and technology.

### The competitive landscape

We reviewed both direct hotel competitors to CitizenM and competitor apps that connect travellers with local tours. CitizenM already has a blog which recommends hidden local experiences, and here we found something interesting: the tour booking apps currently available did not offer similar types of tours. As can be seen below, the likes of AirBnb and Tripadvisor offer a range of touristy and off-the-beaten-track tours, but their apps have a mainstream appeal. No apps currently existed that offered local experiences but targeted the very specific, new breed of traveller that CitizenM targets.

This showed that there was potentially an unfulfilled user need that our app could address.

### Interviewing users

To understand the user situation and problems that the app could solve, we carried out 12 interviews with people that matched the characteristics of the CitizenM customer.

{% image "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*CrMoihqYuhxWiBTCXjRMFA.png" %}

Synthesising the findings into an affinity map, we found three themes across all interviews:

#### Trust

Trust was hugely important for people when deciding on and enjoying local tours and experiences. They valued real locals, authentic experiences and advice from trusted forums. One of our users said:

{% image "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*r6SY0GMwLjaKZoDoSyMITQ.png" %}

#### Balance

Whilst users loved authentic experiences, this didn’t mean they were not interested in touristy experiences. Travellers got the most satisfaction when there was a _balance_ in their itinerary.

{% image "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*2fQShObOv1lZ7yeK6Iz6uw.png" %}

#### Confidence in decisions

Most travellers expressed a desire to be confident that they had booked a good experience. This manifested in various ways, such as extensively reading reviews, asking friends for tips, or checking and comparing multiple sites to find the best things to do.

{% image "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*sHz9pGTc7NE-BOhDj7ryNA.png" %}

### Identifying a key persona

We concocted four personas based on the interviews, representing the broad range goals and frustrations of travellers:

{% image "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2346/1*kjz36qjpm1AfqJ3L96W9BQ.png" %}

Alex, a 33 year old Italian from Florence, became our primary persona because his goals and frustrations closely matched those of our interviewees, and his sense of adventure and love for authenticity closely matched the CitizenM brand. Alex is someone that wants his travel experiences to be authentic, wants to meet real people doing real things, and make lifelong friends. He researches a lot before he travels and loves to pre-book experiences before he goes.

#### Alex’s challenge

With Alex’s goals and frustrations in mind, we formulated a design challenge:

> Enable Alex to browse and book authentic local experiences and reach out to ‘locals’ directly for insights and recommendations.

This challenge not only took into account our persona, but also the brief and the findings from our user interviews and competitive research.

It was now time to move to the Design stage, so, as our Italian stallion Alex would say, ‘Andiamo!’

## Design

### Design Studio

Going into the Design Studio, our aim was to build something that:

- was focussed upon _trust_ and _authenticity_

- balanced both _local_ experiences *and more *tourist-heavy\* experiences

- gave Alex the resources to be _confident_ in his booking decisions.

{% image "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6522/1*-s_w5Sxfumo7_qslVNkVlA.jpeg" %}

A common theme across many of the interviews was that quite a few users would stay in an Airbnb in order to make friends with the local renting out the house, and often the local would then take them out to ‘hidden’ spots that were off the beaten track. Through brainstorming and critique, this lead the team to a key idea: rather than focusing on the tours and experiences themselves, our app would put the focus on the _locals giving the tours_.

By allowing users to search by their interests, connect with locals that they think they’d get along with and then chat to them before booking, the app would allow users to create personalised, authentic experiences, and have 100% confidence in the booking they are making. It would also give locals a way to make money, by signing up for the app and connecting with travellers who are prepared to pay to be taken to authentic cultural experiences.

### Prototyping & testing

We then developed a prototype that demonstrated the idea and the features that were designed in the Design Studio, and started testing with users.

{% image "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/6528/1*f1dfjIQfdpShk6OuyLja3g.jpeg" %}

The prototype involved the user, Alex, visiting the profile of a local called Sam to ask him about the best areas in London to see graffiti. On testing, users weren’t finding the ‘chat’ button where they thought it would be. Since chatting with locals was such an important part of the app, we decided to move the button further up the profile and emphasise the feature with the text ‘Ask me anything!’:

{% image "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*quiUFWdyBV2Ga1DRYhQIJA.png" %}

In testing, we asked the user to search for ‘graffiti tour’ on the app, and initially we designed the prototype to allow the user to tap the ‘search’ icon and type ‘graffiti tours’. We found very quickly that very few users went straight to the search function, and instead would tap the ‘Culture and Arts’ category button in the hopes of finding the graffiti tours. Due to this, we made some large changes to the flow of the app, allowing users to find graffiti tours by browsing the categories:

{% image "https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3342/1*mKAdkKAfCn6WecPHXXrZ7g.png", "Left: the revised user flow; right: users preferred to tap on ‘Culture & Arts’ rather than the search button" %}

When designing at a higher fidelity, we spent a lot of time thinking about the information that needed to be included on the ‘Experience Preview’ panels. We wanted users to know as much about the tour/experience as possible without being overwhelmed with information whilst browsing. Through testing, we found that along with price, our users wanted to see the star rating, as well as the local that was organising the tour. This matched well with our research on the trust and authenticity that the ‘local guide’ represented, and also allowed us to put more focus on the local — a key differentiator with the app.

### Interactive Prototype

You can view the final, high fidelity clickable prototype on Invision [here](https://invis.io/2MDGTB1RN#/253175213_City_Picker). In the mock-up, Alex searches for graffiti tours and then contacts a local to ask him about the best areas for graffiti. He then browses the experiences and adds two of them to his ‘Favourites’. Later, having returned from his trip, he goes to the ‘Post-Experience page’ where he sees photos uploaded by the local guide and then leaves a review of the tour.

## Results

This was a fantastic project and I’m extremely proud of the final product, which solves our user’s problem in an extremely unique way that tested extremely well and received strong feedback. The research into the way that the ‘new breed of traveller’ views authenticity and builds confidence in decisions was extremely interesting and allowed us to create something truly useful that fit well with the CitizenM brand.

### Next Steps

So much was achieved in this two week sprint but there are many other things that I’d like to explore, including:

- **The booking flow:** I’d love to explore how users would book the experiences themselves, as this is an integral part of the overall user experience and is very often make or break for an app.

- **Desktop version of the site:** As we decided to design the experience as a responsive website, or moreover an Optimised Web App, it would be great to design the desktop version. This is especially important because many of our users said that when booking tours, they would do so on their laptops, as it’s usually a more comfortable experience and allows easier comparison between sites.
