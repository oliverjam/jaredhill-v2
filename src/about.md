I’m a freelance  product designer that loves complex problems and beautifully simple solutions.

{% endcallout %}

I nerd out on products that do what users want and then get the hell out the way. I also strongly believe that taking the ego out of design is a necessary step to creating truly user-centric products.

I currently work at [Booking.com](https://www.booking.com) as a Senior Product Designer. Previously, I worked in consulting, where I created products for Ugandan businesspeople, thrifty Londoners, and German energy traders, for companies such as Barclays, RBS, Metlife and Omorovicza.

Right now I’m learning more about:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🇴&nbsp;Object-oriented UX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔗&nbsp;Webflow

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;⚙️&nbsp;Systems thinking

In my spare time, I'm currently enjoying:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🏃&nbsp;Running (training for a half marathon)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🥟&nbsp;Cooking (mainly very spicy Chinese food)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🗺️&nbsp;Maps (staring at them longingly)

I also love teaching: I've been an Instructor Associate at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) and have given presentations at [TechCircus](https://www.techcircustv.com) and [Founders & Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/).
