I nerd out on products that do what users want and then get the hell out the way. I also strongly believe that taking the ego out of design is a necessary step to creating truly user-centric products.

I've created products for a range of users including thrifty Londoners, Ugandan businesspeople, and German energy traders, for companies such as Booking.com, Barclays, RBS, Metlife and Omorovicza. I'm currently working at [Canva](https://www.canva.com/). 

Right now I’m:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;📦&nbsp;&nbsp;Learning about Object-Oriented UX

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🔗&nbsp;&nbsp;Exploring Figma's new 'variables' feature

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;📖&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading Victor Papanek's 'Design for the Real World'

In my spare time, I'm currently enjoying:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🧗‍♂️&nbsp;&nbsp;Climbing (despite a debilitating fear of heights)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🕺&nbsp;&nbsp;Salsa dancing (trying to add to my current repertoire of one single dance move)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;🗺️&nbsp;&nbsp;Maps (just really big on maps)

I also love teaching: I've been an Instructor Associate at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) and have given presentations at [TechCircus](https://www.techcircustv.com) and [Founders & Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/).
