{% callout %}

I’m a product designer that enjoys taking complex problems and turning them into intuitive solutions that people just *get*.

{% endcallout %}

I nerd out on simple, robust products that do what the users want and then get the hell out the way. I also strongly believe that taking the ego out of design is a necessary step to creating truly user-centric products.

I currently work {% layout "right" %}![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*h_B5W3E2CTR7kzuUY2qvNQ.jpeg){% endlayout %} at [Oliver Wyman Digital](https://www.oliverwyman.com/index.html) as a Senior Design Lead. I've been lucky enough to work on projects across the world, creating products for Ugandan businesspeople, thrifty Londoners, and German energy traders, for companies such as Barclays, RBS, Metlife and Omorovicza.  

Right now I’m learning more about: 
- 🇴 Object-oriented UX
- 🔗 Webflow
- ⚙️ Systems thinking

In my spare time, I'm currently enjoying:
- 🏃 Running
- 🥟 Cooking spicy Chinese food
- 🗺️ Looking at maps for long periods of time

I’m an Instructor Associate at [General Assembly](https://generalassemb.ly/) and have given presentations at TechCircus and Founders & Coders.
