I sometimes wonder how the design community - a group of people who pride themselves on their empathy and ability to communicate clearly - have been able to create a such an inaccessible world . that full of buzzwords, is often so gatekeeper-y

## Giving the wrong impression
A developer friend of mine sent me a very frustrated message today, with this attachment:

He questioned why this 'weird gross attitude' was so pervasive in design, and found it dismissive and elitist to say that we shouldn't listen to what users say they want. 

As any Good Designer would do, my first reaction was explain to him the nuance behind the headlines - that what they're saying is that we should focus on the problems that a user has, rather than the solutions that they give us, and that it's our job as designers is to come up with solutions. I used the example of my time building a banking platform in Uganda, where users told us that all they wanted was to know when their documents would be sent, or when their contacts at the bank would call them back. From these solutions, we found the real problem - a lack of transparency - and built a platform in which users could track the process and which removed need the need for them to receive physical documents or call anyone at the bank at all. 

But then, I got thinking - how was this experienced front-end developer able to get such a wrong impression of what was being communicated? Approaching this from a design perspective, I shouldn't put the blame on him, but look at the design issues behind such a mistake. 

## The nuance lost online
Loking at the above screenshot, which sadly includes an article from (gasp) our beloved NNGroup, I have to wonder how, despite all our talk about dark patterns and clickbait, we still have these sweeping, generalised statements dominating the design community? 

Before I go further, I have to point out that this doesn't happen everywhere. My experiences with actual real-life designers is great - most have a fairly good sense of nuance, using a healthy dollop of 'it depends' in their day-to-day design work. Designers in podcasts, books, and talks usually don't have much trouble communicating more balanced and pragmatic opinions.

The places *where* this happens gives us a little clue as to *why* it does. In my experience, we see these kind of statements where you'd expect to see them: on Twitter and Medium, where a user is rewarded for being pithy or contentious. Places where the more controversial something is, the more it will be interacted with. 

This doesn't, however, fully explain the case of the NNGroup - surely they're above basing the title of an article purely off its ability to attract clicks? In this case, I would hazard a guess that the author of the article assumed that the title would be read in the context of the article itself, where the comment is given more nuance as the reader continues down the page. They certainly didn't imagine the title in the context of a search results page, surrounded by a number of other articles that have also attempted the same clickbait-y trick. 

## Let's communicate better
Now, I don't think I'm going to be able to resolve the debate as to whether designers should be held to higher standards in this article. What I would say, however, is that it is our *job* to think of the different contexts that the content we produce will appear in, and of how our users will react to our work. It shouldn't be that hard for us to carry this same thought process over to the titles of our articles, should it? 

Which brings me to my first conclusion: people form assumptions by gleaning headlines, and if we really want to communicate well as a design community, we should design our content to fit this scenario. Meaning that we should try avoid misleading or sweeping statements in article titles. Case closed.

This would have been the end of this rant, if my friend had read further into the NNGroup's article, he would have found sensible opinions. Let's look at the summary: 

> Summary: To design the best UX, pay attention to what users do, not what they say. Self-reported claims are unreliable, as are user speculations about future behavior. Users do not know what they want.

"Users do not know what they want."

Hmm.

### Stupid users and their dumb opinions 
I can forgive NNGroup for a clickbait-y title - after all, we all do it. My most read article ever makes -indirect reference to my own diarrhea-  so I'm no angel. 

However, the idea that a user 'does not know what they want', in my opinion, is not just condescending and dismissive, but it's just plain wrong. Sure, in many cases this *is* true, and there is a kernel of truth to it: that, where possible, we should watch watch a person does, and take what what they say with a pinch of salt. 

There's a very overused and potentially misattributed quote that is often used to justify this kind of thinking: 
> “If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” - Henry Ford
Now, I'm no time traveller (at least not yet!), but I'm sure that there were plenty of intelligent and creative people back then, who, if asked what they wanted, would have almost certainly said 'carriages without horses that go really fast'. 


  asked people what What this comment does is make us feel t makes us feel superior as designers, as the last bastions of what people want. 

The point is, there's nuance here. Sometimes users will ask for a feature that actually *should be added to the platform*, because sometimes users actually know what they want. And whilst you should always I think we as designers can often a

Is it high and mighty of us to think that we are the only ones that can come up with solutions? Is it not part of empathy to respect the creativity of our users and to allow for the possibility that they could be able to come up with a great solution too? 

Sure, we shouldn't put much weight on what a user tells us they want, but
