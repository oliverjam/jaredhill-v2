An interesting way to visualise payments plans

Here's a fun little mockup I did a few years ago showing an interesting way of helping customers to explore payment plans. I was inspired by a pattern used by Polldaddy that I had seen on Twitter, and wanted to explore the concept and make some UX improvements. 

[Here's the original Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/jamchiller/status/1017729374035038208) where you can see the pattern that I based my designs off, as well as a list of the improvements that I made.
